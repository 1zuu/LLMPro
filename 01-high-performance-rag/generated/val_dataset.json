The syndrome was first described in humans but \nhas since been recognized in animals, particularly in companion animals and foals (1,2). Mortality rates vary from up to 60% in humans to almost 100% in small animal species (2). This syn -\ndrome has not been previously reported in a camelid species, but should be included on the list of differential diagnoses for crias with acute onset respiratory distress. Although the prognosis in other species is often guarded, treatment of alpaca crias can \nhave a good outcome.\nCase description\nAn approximately  7-hour-old 5.2-kg female intact Suri alpaca \ncria was presented to the Oklahoma State University Boren \nVeterinary Medical Teaching Hospital with the complaint of \nbeing hypothermic, lethargic, and unable to stand and nurse. \nBy the owners\u2019 records the cria was at least 1 wk premature. The primiparous dam had delivered the cria unassisted and unobserved. Upon finding the cria, the owners determined that she was hypothermic (actual temperature not reported) and attempted to warm her with blankets, a heater, and warm water baths. Attempts were made to milk out the dam, but only 5 mL of colostrum were obtained and were fed to the cria along with \n60\u00a0mL of milk replacer, which the cria suckled readily from a \nbottle. However, lethargy and inability to rise persisted and the cria was admitted to the hospital the following morning.\nOn presentation, the cria was obtunded and unable to main -\ntain sternal recumbency. Rectal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C (98\u00b0F) \n[reference interval (RI): 37.8 to 38.9\u00b0C (100 to 102\u00b0F)], and \nthe pulse was 104 beats/min (RI: 60 to 90 beats/min) with no detectable murmurs or arrhythmias. The respiratory rate was 60 breaths/min (RI: 10 to 30 breaths/min) with no auscultable abnormalities bilaterally, although mild nostril flaring was noted. \nMucous membranes were hyperemic with a capillary refill time \nof , 2 s. The incisors were not erupted, and both ears were \ncurled at the tips. Moderate scleral injection and mild hyphema were present bilaterally. A bilateral nasal oxygen cannula was \nimmediately placed and oxygen administered at 2.5 L/min. A \n20-gauge double lumen J-wire catheter was aseptically placed in the left jugular vein and blood was drawn for aerobic culture, complete blood (cell) count (CBC), and chemistry panel.",

Based on the initial case assessment, 6 mL of 50% dextrose was administered as a bolus followed by a bal -\nanced polyionic electrolyte solution (Normosol-R; Hospira, Lake Forest, Illinois, USA) with 15 mEq potassium chloride and 50% dextrose added to make a 5% solution, administered at 50 mL/kg body weight (BW) per day. A warming blanket (Bair hugger; Arizant, Eden Prairie, Minnesota, USA) was \nplaced over the cria until her temperature rose into the nor -\nmal range. Ceftiofur sodium (Naxcel; Pfizer Animal Health, \nNew\u00a0York, New York, USA) was administered at 5 mg/kg BW, IV, q12h due to clinical evidence of septicemia, and omepra -\nzole (Omeprazole Na; Premier Pharmacy Labs, Weeki Wachee, Florida, USA) was given at 0.5 mg/kg BW, IV, q24h. Flunixin meglumine (Banamine; Schering-Plough Animal Health, Union, \nNew Jersey, USA) was given at 0.3 mg/kg BW, IV, q8h for the \nanti-endotoxic effects [dose extrapolated from data from another species, as there is no published dose for a camelid species in the literature (3)]. Based on the owners\u2019 history of complete failure \nof passive transfer, and the dam\u2019s continued lack of colostrum \nproduction, along with previous administration of milk replacer that may have resulted in reduced IgG absorptive capacity of the small intestine, 250 mL of llama plasma (Triple J Farms; Kent \nLaboratories, Bellingham, Washington, USA) was administered \nIV over 3 h.\nThe cria responded favorably to initial treatment, and within \n3 h was bright and alert and able to maintain sternal recum -\nbency on its own. Every 2 h the cria was offered 50 mL of \nalpaca milk replacer, which she suckled readily from a bottle. \nThe umbilical stalk was dipped in 0.5% chlorhexidine diacetate solution. Physical parameters were monitored hourly along with indirect mean arterial pressure, blood glucose, urine output, and SpO\n2 via pulse oximeter. During the course of the day the \ncria was intermittently mildly tachycardic and tachypneic and continued to flare its nostrils on inspiration but maintained \nan SpO\n2 near 100%. An arterial blood gas revealed a pO2 of \n431\u00a0 mmHg and a pCO2 of 46.9 mmHg with a pH of 7.39 \nwhile on nasal oxygen.\nThe physical parameters were stable by the following day, \nalthough the cria was unable to maintain blood glucose in the \nnormal range without supplementation. The hyphema had resolved bilaterally and was thus attributed to traumatic origin but scleral injection was still present. Because of previously \nreported differences in the clinical presentation of septic crias \ncompared with neonatal ruminant species (4) and the additional risk factors of documented prematurity and initial failure of pas-sive transfer, another CBC was performed. This revealed a leuko -\npenia (4.1 3 10\n3/mL, RI: 4.9 to 11.0 3 103/mL) characterized \nby a neutropenia (neutrophils 2993/ mL, RI: 4600 to 16 000/ mL, \nbands 205/ mL, RI: 0 to 350/ mL). Sepsis was suspected despite \na preliminary negative blood culture.

The respiratory rate remained consistently in the 80s with a minor abdominal \ncomponent. SpO\n2 displayed a downward trend, as it started at \n98% in the morning but decreased to 87% by mid-afternoon. Increased large airway sounds were auscultable diffusely bilat -\nerally, particularly in the caudodorsal lung fields with loss of small airway sounds. The cria also appeared more depressed and lethargic than it had the previous day and became hyporexic. Thoracic radiographs were taken and demonstrated diffuse inter -\nstitial pulmonary infiltrates in all lung lobes, with several small multifocal areas of alveolar pulmonary infiltrate in the dorsal caudal lung lobes and air bronchograms in the caudoventral lung lobes. All pulmonary vessels that could be seen appeared \nwithin normal limits. Arterial blood gas sampled 20 min after \nremoval of nasal oxygen revealed a pO\n2 of 39 mmHg, pCO2 of \n51.8 mmHg, and pH of 7.38, interpreted as hypoxemia with a mild compensated respiratory acidosis.\nThe cria\u2019s clinical condition deteriorated following these \ndiagnostic procedures. Two hours after being placed back on nasal oxygen it was unable to raise its head and inspira -\ntory effort and nostril flare were notably worsened compared with earlier in the day. Acute respiratory distress syndrome was diagnosed based on the following criteria: acute onset of tachypnea and dyspnea with hypoxemia; risk factors including documented prematurity with clinical and laboratory evidence \nof sepsis, indication of trauma, and multiple transfusions; char -\nacteristic radiographic findings; PaO\n2/FiO2 of , 200 mmHg; \nlack of clinical responsiveness to supplemental oxygen; and \nabsence of cardiac abnormalities. Prednisolone sodium succinate \n(Solu-Delta-Cortef; Pfizer Animal Health) was administered at \n5\u00a0mg/kg BW, IV due to the cria\u2019s rapidly deteriorating clinical  \ncondition.\nWithin hours of corticosteroid administration the cria\u2019s clini -\ncal appearance was markedly improved. Although its respiratory \nrate remained higher than the previous day, SpO2 began dis -\nplaying an upward trend and the nostril flare was less apparent. \nThe cria became more responsive to environmental stimuli, \nand was once again able to raise its head. However, hyporexia \npersisted and partial parenteral nutrition (PPN) was initiated with 8.5% amino acids added to 50% dextrose in a 1:1.25 ratio at one-quarter of the calculated daily caloric requirement. The fluid rate was decreased by the same amount per hour as the \nPPN in order to keep the total volume of fluids administered \nper hour at a maintenance rate to avoid increased pulmonary capillary pressures and excess extravascular lung water. The \nnext day the respiratory rate remained increased although small \nairway sounds could occasionally be ausculted; crackles were detected diffusely and bilaterally. Thoracic ultrasonography was performed and revealed mild right-sided cranioventral lung lobe atelectasis as well as bilaterally diffuse finely grained hyper -\nechoic images immediately deep to the pulmonary pleura with reduction of reverberation artifact, consistent with pulmonary edema. Cardiac ultrasound findings were within normal limits. Prednisolone sodium succinate was again administered IV  \nbut\u00a0at a tapered dose (one-tenth of the dose given the previous day).",

Therapy was continued as previously described although corticosteroids \nwere discontinued after the second dose because of a concern \nover immunosuppression in a neonate with probable sepsis. Ketoprofen (Ketofen; Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort\u00a0Dodge, Iowa, USA) was administered instead at 2.2 mg/kg BW, IV, q24h as it has been shown in horses to have similar anti- \ninflammatory properties as other nonsteroidals but with less \npotential for nephrotoxicity and gastric mucosal ulceration \n(5). Parenteral vitamin E and selenium were administered once \nsubcutaneously (Bo-Se; Schering-Plough Animal Health, Union, \nNew Jersey, USA) for their antioxidant properties.\nSix days after the initial radiographic study, repeat thoracic \nradiographs revealed a decrease in the unstructured interstitial \npattern within the caudodorsal lungs. Air bronchograms were \nagain noted in the same regions but were less pronounced. The cria\u2019s heart rate returned to the normal range over the next few days; a favorable prognostic indicator (6). Overall, the \ncrias\u2019s condition appeared to be slowly improving. The patient \nremained hospitalized until pO\n2 normalized and abnormal clini -\ncal signs completely resolved. Twenty days after she was admit -\nted an arterial blood gas revealed a pO2 of 80 mmHg, pCO2 of \n44.2\u00a0mmHg, and pH of 7.40 on room air. Supplemental oxygen was gradually discontinued as were other treatments. At 29 days \nof age the cria was discharged from the hospital.\nDiscussion\nAn acute respiratory distress syndrome was first reported in adult \nhumans in 1967 (7,8). The term adult respiratory distress syn -\ndrome (ARDS) was coined to describe the signs of tachypnea, \nhypoxemia, panlobular infiltrates on thoracic radiographs, and \nloss of lung compliance (9). The syndrome was later referred to as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (10,11), and a similar syndrome resembling that of ARDS in humans has since been recognized in animals, primarily in dogs, cats, and foals \n(1,2). This is the first report that the authors are aware of in \nwhich ARDS was diagnosed in a camelid species.\nSince the 1980s, consensus groups have developed definitions \nfor acute lung injury (ALI) and ARDS in human and veteri -\nnary medicine (8,10,11). In 2007 the definition of veterinary ARDS included 4 required criteria: acute onset of tachypnea; known risk factors including infection, sepsis, trauma, and multiple transfusions; evidence of pulmonary capillary leak with -\nout increased pulmonary capillary pressure, demonstrable by bilateral/diffuse infiltrates on thoracic radiographs; and evidence of inefficient gas exchange, demonstrable by hypoxemia with a PaO\n2/FiO2 ratio of # 200 mmHg (8). A fifth criterion that \nwas highly recommended was evidence of diffuse pulmonary inflammation (8). A related clinical syndrome with different \netiology is now referred to as neonatal equine respiratory distress \nsyndrome (NERDS) and is believed to be similar to infant respi -\nratory distress syndrome (IRDS), also known as RDS or hyaline membrane disease (8). This syndrome (RDS) is believed to be a primary surfactant deficiency similar to that seen in human neonates, and has been described in lambs, calves, and foals (12). Respiratory distress syndrome was considered unlikely in this case based on the delayed onset ( . 60 h postpartum) \nand continual worsening of clinical signs. Respiratory distress \nsyndrome usually begins within 10 to 15 min following parturi -\ntion, and clinical signs reach a peak after approximately 1 h (12).",

Respiratory distress \nsyndrome usually begins within 10 to 15 min following parturi -\ntion, and clinical signs reach a peak after approximately 1 h (12). \nAdditionally, many equine neonatologists agree that primary surfactant deficiency rarely plays a role in acute respiratory dis -\ntress in foals (1), although it is widely recognized that surfactant \ndysfunction is a component of the underlying pathophysiology \nin ARDS patients (13).\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome is not a disease entity but \nrather the end result of either intra- or extra-pulmonary patho -\nlogic processes resulting in diffuse alveolar damage. Common predisposing intrapulmonary insults include pneumonia, aspi -\nration of gastric contents, and pulmonary contusion. Extra-pulmonary diseases predisposing to ARDS include infection, \nsepsis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, trauma, and \nmultiple transfusions (8,14,15). The initial insult results in an inflammatory response intended to eradicate infection and repair \ntissue damage (14,15). In some individuals the immune response \nbecomes self-destructive and results in leukocyte adhesion to the pulmonary vasculature followed by release of cytokines, vasoactive substances, and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species that ultimately lead to interstitial pulmonary edema (14,16).\nDifferential diagnosis for ARDS has historically included \nupper airway obstruction, pneumothorax, pleuropneumonia, pleural effusion, aspiration pneumonia, pneumonia of bacterial or viral origin, and congenital cardiac anomalies (14). Upper airway obstruction was ruled out by the absence of stridor \nand strong bilateral nasal airflow (14). Pneumothorax, pleural \neffusion, and congenital cardiac abnormalities were ruled out based on auscultation, and radiographic and ultrasonographic imaging. Pleuropneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, and pneu -\nmonia of infectious origin could not be completely ruled out but may occur concurrently with ARDS (14). Clinical signs of pneumonia including pyrexia, coughing, nasal discharge, and harsh crackles and wheezes on auscultation were not observed in this cria. However, the 4 required criteria recently described by \nthe Dorothy Russell Havemeyer Consensus Workshop on ALI/\nARDS in Veterinary Medicine as being essential to a diagnosis of ARDS were all met. Additional diagnostics to confirm the fifth described criterion could have included a transtracheal \nwash or bronchoalveolar lavage to document cytologic evidence \nof pulmonary inflammation but this procedure was considered too risky in this compromised neonate (8).\nTreatment of ARDS is aimed at improving oxygenation, \ntherapy for the primary disease process, attenuating the inflam -\nmatory response and providing supportive care (14). Oxygen insufflation at 2.5 L/min was considered adequate in a patient this size; ideally a second arterial blood gas with the patient on supplemental oxygen would document the expected minimal \nimprovement in a case of ARDS. The stress of obtaining a \nblood gas in a compromised patient and the detrimental effects that may be the result of such a procedure must be considered. Antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, parenteral nutritional and fluid support, and antioxidants were also used in this case.",

However, a more recent review of the human literature \nfound that evidence supporting the administration of low- to moderate-dose corticosteroids in the treatment of early ARDS (defined as , 7 days\u2019 duration) was controversial (18).\nAdditional treatments that have recently been reviewed in the \nveterinary literature include mechanical ventilation, inhalation of nitric oxide, or administration of surfactant (1). Lack of con -\ntrolled studies in addition to economic constraints precluded the use of these therapeutic options in this case.\nFor crias presented with acute onset of respiratory distress, \nARDS should be included on the list of differential diagnoses. This syndrome can have a favorable outcome, despite historically \nhigh mortality rates reported in other animal species. Complete \nhistory and physical examination, diagnostic imaging, and arte -\nrial blood gas analysis may be used to attempt to differentiate ARDS from other insults to the respiratory system. Treatment \nof ARDS in camelids appears to be similar to that described in \nother species.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Dr. Todd Holbrook for assistance with this case.

DE A., AND PEDRO SALINAS \nAuthors are researchers of the Agroecology Program, Institute de Investigaciones Agropecuarias (INIA), La Platina Experimental Station, Casilla 439-3, \nSantiago, Chile. \nAbstract \nA study of liveweight changes of alpaca adult males, females, \nand their progeny, was conducted through 3 seasons under COD \ntinuous grazing on natural grasslands on the Mediterranean \nrange of the Chilean Central Zone. Liveweight changes were posi- \ntive and highest in spring (100 to 200 g day\u2019), moderate during \nwinter (50 to 100 g day-l), and negative only at the end of summer \nand in fall (-110 to -150 g day\u2019). Weight gains of new born \nalpacas were greatest (110 to 150 g day\u2019) in the first !I0 days after \nbirth and Lhen decreased slightly, reaching values of 75 g day1 at \n8.5 months old. Weight gains stabilized at 10 tu 20 g day\u2019 at 3- \nyears of age. The average annual fibre production was 1.57 and \n2.36 kg in females and males, respectively; staple length varied \nbetween 8 and 10 cm. \nKey Words: South American Camelids, fiber production \nAlpaca @ma pucos Linn.) is a domestic species found in the \nAltiplanic ecosystems of Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, and Chile \n(Fowler 1989). In Chile, alpacas are distributed mainly over the \nAltiplanic Chilean Zone of Tarapaca, with an estimated popula- \ntion of 32,00 animals. Alpacas develop in cold, dry highland \nenvironments. Their diet is based exclusively on natural flood \ngrasslands (\u201cbofedales\u201d) and drylands (\u201cpajonales\u201d and \n\u201ctolares\u201d), the former being much more important. The alpaca is \na specialized feeder with restricted habitat (De Carolis 1987). The \nspecialization in habitat and diet could imply a low adaptability \nto different environmental, feeding, and management conditions. \nHowever, preliminary evaluations showed alpacas to be well \nadapted to different conditions (Crossley et al. 1990), and main- \ntained suitable growth and productivity (Castellaro and Garcia- \nHuidobro 1991). This species represents an important genetic \nresource and potential alternative of fiber production for marginal \nareas, not only in the Altiplanic Zone, but also in rangelands of \nthe Chilean Mediterranean Central Zone. This study was conduct- \ned to determine alpacas\u2019 liveweight gain and fiber production on \nrangeland of the Chilean Central Zone. \nStudy Area \nThis study was conducted at the Hidango Experimental \nSubstation (Lat. 34\u201d 7\u2019 S; Long. 71\u2019 44\u2019 W; elevation 304 m). \nResearch was funded by Fundacion Andes. \nManuscript accepted 8 Mar. 1998. \nJOURNAL OF RANGE MANAGEMENT 51(5), September 1998 Resumen \nDurante tres temporadas, se efectu6 un estudio orientado a \nevahuu 10s cambios de peso vivo de alpalcas adultas, machos y \nhembras, coma tambien su progenie, que pastorearon continua- \nmente una pradera natural la zona mediterranea central de \nChile.

Liveweight variation in alpaca flock, 1990-1993. \nResults and Discussion \nChanges in liveweight of adult animals \nWhen the evaluation period started (June 1990) average \nliveweights were 45 kg for males and 50 kg for females (Fig. 3). \nDuring the study period females gained about half as much \nweight per day (13.7 g day-l) as males (22.4 g day-l). This \nimplies that females and males continued growing until reaching \nthe mature weight at about 6 years of age. At this age they had \ncompleted their full dental development and have reached their \nmature skeletal size (Calle 1982, Buztinza 1991). At the end of \nthe evaluation period (April 1993), females stabilized their \nweights around 65 kg and males near 74 kg (Fig. 3). These values \nwere higher than those reported on alpacas in the Altiplanic envi- \nronment (Bustinza 1991), and similar to those reported by Davis \net al. (1991), on Chilean alpacas managed with white clover-grass \ngrassland, in New Zealand.

In the winter period, liveweight gains were \nsmall, and decreased, reaching values near zero at the end of July. \nThen liveweight gains increased reaching their highest values in \nOctober; this coincides with the greatest rates of biomass increase \nof the grassland (Fig. 2) and its higher metabolizable energy and \ncrude protein concentrations (Table 2). After October, liveweight \ngain began to decrease, being negative during the fall and the \nbeginning of winter. Those last periods are critical, because of the \nlowest metabolizable energy concentrations in the forage (Table \n2) and its capacity to supply maintenance requirements of the ani- \nmals. According to San Martin (199 l), for an alpaca of 62 kg of \nliveweight, forge intake should have concentrations near 7.74 Mj \nkg-1 of metabolizable energy and 7.7% of crude protein to meet \nthe maintenance requirements of animals. \nFemale Growth Curve \nLiveweights of growing females, measured from birth to 900 \ndays old, are shown in Figure 5.

During the fist 90 \ndays since birth, females gain between 1 IO-150 g day-i, reaching \nan average liveweight of 18.1 kg at 12 weeks of age, when ani- \nmals have a ruminal activity similar to that of an adult (San Martin \n1991). When the animals are 8.5 months old, they have reached \n34.7 kg of liveweight with a liveweight gain of 75 g day-t. When \nthe animals are 1 year old they weigh about 41.5 kg with a weight \ngain between 50 and 60 g day-t. At 3 years old, they weigh about \n59.4 kg with a weight gain of lo-20 g day-l. Their weight \nexceeds 62 kg at 7 years of age. These results show that growth \nconditions for alpacas under extensive grazing on a \nMediterranean Range are better than those for alpacas of the \nsame age on Altiplanic environment (Bustinza 1991). Under \nmediterranean conditions, it is possible to wean early, with a \nliveweight of 18-20 kg and first mate one-year-olds with a mini- \nmum liveweight of 4042 kg. In pasture conditions similar to \nthose in New Zealand, higher birth weights and average daily \nweight gains than those reported in Mediterranean grasslands can \nbe expected (Davis et al. 1991). Although alpacas grow faster \nunder better nutritioinal conditions, when the growth coefficient \n(CGRO) from the preceeding equation is compared to that of \nother herbivores, such as sheep, the CGRO appears relatively \nlow (Brody 1945, reported by Standing Committee on \nAgriculture 1990).

Average values (* SE) were 2.36 \nf 0.08 and 1.57 + 0.06 for males and females, respectively. \nFleece production was lower in 1991 than in the other 2 years, \nprobably because the time between shearing was only 320 days. \nInteraction between year and sex was not significant (P = 0.476). \nThe fleece percentage was higher for males (76.0 + 1.2%) than \nfor females (69.1 + 0.8%), and higher in 1990 than in 1991 or \n1992. Year.* sex interaction was significant at P = 0.06. Values \ndetermined for these fleece parameters are similar to those report- \ned for these animals in altiplanic conditions (Calle 1982; Bustinza \n1991), and slightly lower than those determined in New Zealand \n(Davis et al. 1991). \nStaple Length \nVariation in staple length of adult alpaca fleeces during 1991 \nand 1992, is shown in Figure 6. The corresponding regression \nequations are shown in Table 4. Staple length shows a lineal \ngrowth, with no great seasonal and nutritional restrictions causing \nnegative variations in the liveweight changes. Staple growth \nrates, measured throughout the slope of determined regression \nlineal equation, are shown in Table 5. When the Student \nHypothesis Test was used to test differences between slopes of \ndetermined regression lineal equations, there were no differences \nbetween fiber growth in males and females. However, in both \nsexes, growth in 1991 was greater than during 1992. The average \nstaple length of both males and females at the time of shearing \nwas 9.8 f 1.0 cm in 1991, and 8.4 + 0.6 cm in 1992. These values \nare similar to those cited by Russel(l990) for alpacas. Therefore, \nthe minimum fiber length required by indurstry can be obtained \nfrom annual shearing. \nTable 4.

N.Y. \nNatural Mediterranean grasslands can provide alpaca mainte- \nnance requirements plus that needed for growth and fleece pro- \nduction. However, supplemental feeding, especially for females, \nshould be provided from the middle of summer through the \nbeginning of winter for maximum production. Growth is faster on \nMediterranean grasslands than on the Andean High Plateau grass- \nlands and in the Altiplanic environment. Acceptable fleece pro- \nduction can be obtained from annual shearing. However, more \nresearch is needed to maximize alpaca fleece production under \nthese conditions. \nLiterature Cited \nBustinza, V. 1991. Mejoramiento genetico, p. 113-128.
